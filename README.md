concentration
=============

PhET 'Concentration' simulation

Watch your solution change color as you mix chemicals with water. Then check molarity
with the concentration meter. What are all the ways you can change the concentration
of your solution? Switch solutes to compare different chemicals and find out how
concentrated you can go before you hit saturation!
